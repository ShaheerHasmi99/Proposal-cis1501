# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
The Four Horseman


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A childhood game come to fruition. a text/dnd style rpg game with a story and lore of my own.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project itself, is an text based rpg. essentially a fixed story with some available paths to take. creat a story driven game with turn based combat. like the zelda games with some grunts and huffs for the characters speaking, while some music plays in the background. The process is to try and make a game that has a expierence system(leveling up), spells, turn based combat against enemies. the pong assignment especially helped that i need to seperate objects and code. creating code for ai and the player. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
I do not plan on.
TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
I will be working alone.
TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A good outcome is creating a battle system, experience for the player, and the intro for the story. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

creating a variety of enemies with drops, higher progession for the player, and further progression into the story.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

*The enemies with different attributes (defences, weapons, specific drops.). 
*a party system.
*deep into the story of the game adding the twists that I want to.
*dialog, and more sound affects
*shops and other interactions
*extensive side quests.



## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

there are many more things that i could learn to help me progress this from a text rpg to something a lot greater. In reality the final idea would be a 3d action rpg similar to the new Final Fantasy design. I would have to learn other game engines such Unreal, Unity, and more. the idea to have intertwined quests and even greater story telling. I do not believe this project will completley full my wish for this game. However, even if that may be the case. with a 'basic' rpg in this project, it will help expand my knowledge and help me make something more extensive. I would have to learn to create my own sounds and effects and implement them. More so learn to animate actions or combat and transform this text base rpg into a 2d or 3d space. working with others although i am not doing it now can only benifit as not many can get far without the help of others.
